# Personal Projects
Welcome to my personal project repository! This project contains various notebooks pertaining to data collection/scraping and also some analysis. It provides scripts and tools to fetch data from various sources and store it for further analysis and exploration.

## Data Collection Project Overview
This project aims to leverage APIs and web scraping to gather valuable data from diverse sources. By utilizing these techniques, I aim to collect data on specific topics of interest and organize it for future analysis and insights. This personal project allows me to explore different APIs, websites, and data collection methodologies.

### Current Notebooks
1. [Tweet Scraper](https://github.com/jytan023/projects/blob/main/Tweet_Scraper.ipynb) - Collect tweets of some Twitter accounts that I follow that post informational content regarding the field of Quantitative Finance and AI. The data is stored in a Google sheet, with each tab containing the tweets of a user. This was done using the snscrape and gspread package. The Google sheet link is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boWqT_Q7Zl0iRGDmYWVHC2Wxvw77kcrq5r8Q7ZJbBB0/edit?usp=sharing). *Update: snscrape is currently down due to changes to Twitter scraping limit, the notebook is currently not working.*
2. [yahooquery stock screener](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DKl3Dgur3FCv9qWSbI6ovRFt_KPQMfFO#scrollTo=nxFgUOGkPHOD) - Obtain company data for personal analysis. 

## Data Analysis Project Overview
This project aims to conduct EDA and ML using Python and packages such as sklearn, statsmodel, and seaborn. This personal project allows me to recap my knowledge and experience in the subject matter.

### Current Notebooks
1. JPMorgan Quantitative Research virtual experience tasks - Conducted simple EDA and Linear Regression to predict natural gas price and price natural gas contracts. Conducted credit risk analysis using Logistics Regression to predict defaulting cases.

2. [Simple Momentum Strategy](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UBhh5HFEldjxSVpQNlH7EsPVoaSOc4RR?usp=sharing) - A simple momentum strategy by buying the top n performing stocks in the S&P 500 universe based on the past x month and hold for 1 month. At the end of each month close off the existing position and repeat the strategy. The strategy was backtested and evaluated its performance with different parameters 'n' and 'x', and against a buy and hold strategy on the SPY Index.
